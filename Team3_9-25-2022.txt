Ideas for getting the information to plug into the machine learning algorithm:
 - Have the program capture groups of data at a time
 - Then try to start capturing when the person is starting to think up.
 - Then stop when the person is stopping thinking up. (Or approximately)
 - Or have the machine learning capture like a minute of data and then have the machine recognize the paturns in that and label them as say "up".
 - Probably this one ^
